        How many times you wanted to reuse asp.net artifacts like usercontrols, or even pages? <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/">Dan Wahlin</a> posted to the <a href="http://aspadvice.com">aspadvice.com</a> list regards this issue. He wanted to reuse a master page accross different websites (hosted on different vdirs).<br>
I've recommended him reading <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/08/28/423888.aspx">this post</a> from <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">ScottGu</a>
and he got working a first version. The idea is to sign and publish the
website and put it on the GAC. Then on the website that you want to reuse create an empty
masterpage and make it inherits from the GAC masterpage class. The
entire post can be <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/archive/2005/11/16/430779.aspx">read here</a>.<br>
