<p>The p&amp;p client team is working hard on getting hands on labs for both <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/smartclient">Smart Client Software Factory/CAB</a> and <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/websf">Web Client Software Factory</a>Â out of the door. I&#39;ve been following the work they&#39;ve been doing and I must say that the labs are the most insightful labs I ever seen.</p><p><a href="/blogs/mariano">Mariano</a> was heavily involved in the creation of the labs and he really knows the technology, so the quality of the labs is pretty good. Now he&#39;s <a href="/blogs/mariano/archive/2007/09/06/Feedback-on-SC_2D00_SF-Hands-On-Labs.aspx">asking for feedback</a> on the Smart Client labs since a final release of them is coming that will show how to use the Disconnected Service Agent and the WPF support. He also <a href="/blogs/mariano/archive/2007/09/06/Web-Client-Software-Factory-Hands-On-Labs-released.aspx">announced</a> that the labs for Web Client Software Factory are <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/websf/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=6897">available to download</a>.</p>
