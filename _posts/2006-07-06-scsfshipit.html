<p>As <a href="http://www.peterprovost.org/archive/2006/07/05/16710.aspx">Peter</a> announced and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/archive/2006/06/11/626456.aspx">Eugenio</a> already hinted, the first pattern &amp; practices Software Factory has been released. Go <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/scsflp.asp">download it from here</a>.</p>  <p>I had the pleasure to <a href="/blogs/matiaswoloski/archive/2006/05/20/WorkingPnp.aspx">work with the Smart Client Software Factory team</a> the past two months. We did a great effort to ship with lots of features, how-tos, reference implementations, automated guidance for Visual Studio 2005, new patterns, all related to CAB, Smart Client and the UX area in general.</p>  <p>The following picture has been taken the day previous to the release at 11:30pm. This is only half of the team.</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2008/06/pp.jpg"><img height="352" alt="p&amp;p" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2008/06/pp-thumb.jpg" width="499" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p><i>From right to left: Deiva (testing), Eugenio (PDM), Blaine (PM), Alan (Dev Lead) and me</i></p>  <p>It's been great working with these guys!</p>  <p>What's next? Hands-On-Labs for Developers and Architects, a ClickOnce    <br />chapter, VB Guidance packages, and a few other surprises.</p>
