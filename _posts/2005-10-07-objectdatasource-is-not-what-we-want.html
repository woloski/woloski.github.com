        I couldn't agree more <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/aaguiar/archive/2005/09/19/425518.aspx">with this post</a> from <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/aaguiar/">Andres Aguiar</a>. The model for databinding in Winforms 2 was greatly enhanced with <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms158145">BindingSource</a>, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms158105">BindingNavigator</a> and cia. However the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dz12d98w">intermediaries</a> <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/9a4kyhcx.aspx">controls</a> in ASP.Net 2 are not useful at all. I see them only used on <u>very simple</u> scenarios with a <u>very simple</u>
business layer or in a prototypes for the case of SqlDatasource. I'm
sure this is very useful for people doing small applications that like
development ala MS Access drag n drop, but for enterprise scenarios
these controls are a big no. I hope to see some new *DataSource
controls that addresses these issues.<br>
