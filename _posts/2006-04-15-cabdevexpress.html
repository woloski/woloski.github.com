        One of the benefits of <a href="http://codegallery.gotdotnet.com/cab">CAB</a> is the abstraction it provides regarding the undetlying toolkit. I've <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/matiaswoloski/archive/2006/03/27/297.aspx">blogged</a> about the Command, UIElements and Workspace subsystem before.<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.infragistics.com/resource/Technologies/CAB/">Infragistics</a> guys implemented this layer for their toolkit. <br>
<a href="http://devexpress.com/Products/NET/">DevExpress</a> is another toolkit but they haven't invested in providing the CAB layer yet. Some people in the <a href="http://codegallery.gotdotnet.com/cab">CAB</a> messageboards <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/messageboard/thread.aspx?id=22f72167-af95-44ce-a6ca-f2eafbf2653c&amp;mbid=5194517d-42c9-4cfd-b7a5-87d7cebc6c60&amp;threadid=57b87610-7d53-4233-a3a7-002ee68b3a07">asked about this</a>.
I offered my help and recommended them to open a workspace in
gotdotnet. Vincent from France created the gotdotnet workspace and we
havenow 8 members willing to help building this. <br>
<br>
If you are interested as well please <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=13b0773f-3e75-47da-9a2a-f32a59050bef">join us</a><br>
