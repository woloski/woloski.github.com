        Setup secure conversation using WSE 3 was very simple. You just need to
add two attributes to the secure policy assertion
(usernameOverCertificate, mutual, etc).<br>

<pre>establishSecurityContext="true" renewExpiredSecurityContext="true"<br></pre>The
problem was when I wanted to establish the secure conversation, get the
token and use it in further requests. Secure conversation means just
this:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Send a first request with a UsernameToken (username/password), BinarySecurityToken (certificate).</li>
  <li>The service will reply with two messages: the response of the
original request and a RequestSecurityTokenResponse which will have the
SecurityContextToken issued</li>
  <li>Grab the SecurityContextToken</li>
  <li>Send a second request with a SecurityContextToken (now there is
no need to send UsernameToken or whatever which means more performance
and security)</li>
</ol>
How this four steps are translated into code?<br>
<br>
1 and 2.<br>
<pre>WseProxy proxy = <span class="kwrd">new</span> WseProxy();<br>proxy.SetClientCredential(<span class="kwrd">new</span> UsernameToken(txtUser.Text, txtPass.Text, PasswordOption.SendPlainText));<br>proxy.SetPolicy(<span class="str">"ClientPolicy"</span>);<br>SomeResponse respone = proxy.DoRequest();</pre>
3.<br>
<pre>SecureConversationCorrelationState correlationState = <b>proxy.ResponseSoapContext.SessionState.Get()</b>;<br><span class="kwrd">if</span> (correlationState != <span class="kwrd">null</span>)<br>{<br>     <span class="rem">// Get the SCT for the current conversation</span>
     sct = correlationState.Token <span class="kwrd">as</span> SecurityContextToken;<br>}</pre>
4. <br>
<pre>WseProxy proxy = <span class="kwrd">new</span> WseProxy();<br><b>proxy.SetClientCredential(sct);</b><br>proxy.SetPolicy(<span class="str">"ClientPolicy"</span>);<br>SomeResponse respone = proxy.DoRequest();</pre>
The trick is in the step 3 where we are getting the
SecurityContextToken from the session state under the response soap
context. We could store this sct in the ASP.Net Session, or in a static
variable for Winforms and use it for further requests.<br>
