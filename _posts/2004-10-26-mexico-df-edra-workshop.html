        <P>We (Alejandro Jack and me) are giving a 5-day <A href="http://www.southworks.net/en/prd/training/edra.aspx">EDRA workshop</A> in Mexico DF. So far we are at day 2, and I think people is transiting from â€œstunned and crushedâ€ to â€œinformative skepticismâ€ state... Hope that by the end of the week people get to the â€œunderstanding and approvalâ€ state.</P>
<P>Update: I think people now is transiting the â€œinformative skepticismâ€ to â€œunderstanding and approvalâ€ state</P>
