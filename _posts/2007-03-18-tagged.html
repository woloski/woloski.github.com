<p>I finally found the time to write 5 things about me after being tagged by <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/aaguiar/archive/2007/01/12/the-5-things.aspx">Andres Aguiar</a>, <a href="http://clariusconsulting.net/blogs/pga/archive/2007/01/05/11702.aspx">Pablo Galiano</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/archive/2007/01/15/i-m-it-too-tagged-by-ed.aspx">Eugenio Pace</a> and <a href="http://diegumzone.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!1AD5096D63670065!593.entry">Diego Dagum</a>.</p><p>1. My first computer was a 386DX. Since there was nothing to do I decided to learn the DOS help side by side :) After knowing everything about DOS and hacking autoexec.bat and config.sys I moved to do Quick Basic simple games... cool. </p><p>2. I&#39;ve played piano since I was 10 years old. That&#39;s my wire to earth (in spanish "mi clabe a tierra"). Play tennis and footbal are the sports I like to do. I&#39;m living with my girlfriend for 2 years now, but still not married...</p><p>3. I live and love Argentina. I believe there is no better place to live than here despite of everyday problems and the unstable situation, politically and economically speaking.</p><p>4. I&#39;ve worked since my high school graduation at 18 years old. I&#39;ve been always fan of the latest technology and I am always willing to learn new things. I&#39;m working at <a href="http://www.southworks.net/">Southworks</a> and this company and the people working here allowed me to do this kind of things and always pushed me to the next level.</p><p>5. I&#39;m 26 years old and currently I&#39;m developing my thesis exploring "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_Service">Software as a Service</a>" to get my engineering degree in the <a href="http://www.fi.uba.ar/">University of Buenos Aires</a>.</p><p>Now, I pass the ball to: <a href="/blogs/mariano/">Mariano Szklanny</a>, <a href="/blogs/johnny">Johnny Halife</a>, <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/lopez/">Angel "Java" Lopez</a>, <a href="/blogs/ariel/">Ariel Schapiro</a> and <a href="http://www.computerapia.com/">Juan Pablo Garcia</a>.</p>
