<p><a href="http://staff.southworks.net/johnny">We</a>'ve been working with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/default.mspx">Microsoft Learning</a> group at Redmond to define the upcoming TS (Technology Specialist) exam for WCF 3.5. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/howard_dierking/">Howard Dierking</a> hosted the design session and it was a great experience. </p> <p>He explained us the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/howard_dierking/archive/2007/01/18/why-new-gen.aspx">refactoring of the exam stack</a>. Now they have these new TS exams that are specific to a single technology and other exams on top of TS called PRO that will be more scenario oriented. They are doing the right thing by bringing Subject Matter Experts to the design sessions. We brainstormed on the most important aspects of WCF that someone should be tested on.</p> <p>I'll be waiting for the beta exams to see how it finally shapes... </p>
