<p>Back in 2007 I had the pleasure of working with people like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/eugeniop/">Eugenio Pace</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/gianpaolo/">Gianpaolo Carraro</a>, e<a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2010/10/image3.png"><img style="margin:;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2010/10/image3-thumb.png" width="288" height="126" /></a>xploring the unexplored territories of “software delivered like <em>electricity”</em>. We did <a href="http://litwarehr.codeplex.com/">LitwareHR</a> together, the first software as a service sample application released by Microsoft… At that time I was looking for the topic of <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/2008/09/28/thesis-software-as-a-service/">my thesis</a> and Eugenio encouraged me to write about Software as a Service. The word <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cloud_computing">cloud computing</a></em> was going to appear in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cloud_computing&amp;oldid=172335902">Wikipedia in November 2007</a>…</p>  <p>Fast forward to October 2010, Microsoft is in a much better position to give guidance about building this kind of applications. I think because there are better tools (ie. the whole Azure offering) and more demand for these kind of app models.</p>  <p>In this context, last week <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vbertocci/archive/2010/10/07/new-online-demo-introducing-fabrikamshipping-saas.aspx">Vittorio Bertocci</a> released “<a href="http://www.fabrikamshipping.com/">FabrikamShipping</a> in SaaS Sauce”. I’m really happy to be able to participate and help in the development of this solution with the rest of the <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/">Southworks</a> team (<a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/siacomuzzi">iaco</a>, pc, lito, <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/raffanacho/">nacho</a>, <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/nzeitlin/">nico</a> and the QA team) and Vittorio as usual does a great job explaining what this is about in the <a href="http://www.fabrikamshipping.com/">intro video</a>.</p>  <p>Since there is a lot to cover and there are things that the community will benefit from, I will write some posts about the app covering different topics from the dev point of view. <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2010/10/logo.png"><img style="margin:;padding-left: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-top: 0px" border="0" alt="logo" align="right" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2010/10/logo-thumb.png" width="304" height="54" /></a></p>  <blockquote>   <p><em></em></p>    <ul>     <li><em>A reusable pattern for building subscription based apps on the Windows Azure platform </em></li>      <li><em>General-purpose onboarding UI engine </em></li>      <li><em>Full isolation and multi-tenant application deployment styles </em></li>      <li><em>Integration with PayPal Adaptive Payment APIs for one-time and preapproved continuous payments </em></li>      <li><em>How to run complex processes in Worker Roles, including compensation logic and handling external events </em></li>      <li><em>Message-activated task execution </em></li>      <li><em>Handling notifications </em></li>      <li><em>Automated provisioning </em></li>      <li><em>Email notifications </em></li>      <li><em>Dynamic Source Code customization and creation of Windows Azure packages via CSPACK from a worker role </em></li>      <li><em>Creation of SQL Azure databases from a worker role </em></li>      <li><em>Self-service authorization settings </em></li>      <li><em>Using the Access Control Service (ACS) Management API for automating access and relationship handling </em></li>      <li><em>A fully functional user onboarding system from multiple web identity providers, including account activation via automate mails </em></li>      <li><em>Multi-tenant MVC application authentication based on Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) </em></li>      <li><em>Securing Odata services with ACS and full WIF integration </em></li>      <li><em>...and much more</em> </li>   </ul></blockquote>
