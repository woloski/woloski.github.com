<p>The power of the community is amazing. </p> <p>Some months ago I was reading a <a href="http://www.chrisholmesonline.com/2006/04/21/cab-outlookbar/">post from Chris Holmes</a> who has a nice idea about creating an outlook bar extension site for CAB applications (the outlook left bar who has the Mail, Calendar, etc). I decided to dedicate some hours to it and came up with the <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/matiaswoloski/archive/2006/05/01/OutlookBar.aspx">Outlook Bar workspace</a>.</p> <p>In 5 months almost 1,000 people downloaded it! The other day I came across with a an article in CodeProject written by <a href="http://arnabchoudhuri.blogspot.com/2006/09/i-wrote-article-on-smart-client.html">Arnab Choudhuri</a> </p> <p><a title="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/smartclientoutlookbar.asp" href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/smartclientoutlookbar.asp">http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/smartclientoutlookbar.asp</a></p> <p>It explains how to use the workspace from the scratch... :)</p>
