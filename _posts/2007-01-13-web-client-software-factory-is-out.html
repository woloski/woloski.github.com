<p>Go get it from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webclientfactory">http://msdn.microsoft.com/webclientfactory</a></p> <p>Lot of stuff shipped:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/websf/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Page%20Flow%20Application%20Block">PageFlow Application Block</a>: design the navigation process of a web application using a state machine from <a href="http://wf.netfx3.com/">Windows Workflow Foundation</a>.  <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/websf/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Composite%20Web%20Application%20Block">Composite Web Application Block</a>: helps you build web clients composed of independent, yet cooperating, modules and increase productivity and reduce overall development time through consolidating architect and developer efforts. From the wiki:  <ul> <li><em>Decompose a complex Web site into independent visual and non-visual parts that can be built, assembled, and deployed by independent teams. </em> <li><em>Minimize cross-team dependencies that allows team specialization for areas such as UI design, business logic implementation (business logic development may occur across multiple teams), and infrastructure code development. </em> <li><em>Utilize an architecture that promotes reusability across independent teams. </em> <li><em>Increase the quality of applications by abstracting common services that are available for the independent teams to use. </em> <li><em>Promote proven practices for security without requiring everyone to be a security expert. </em> <li><em>Incrementally deploy new capabilities while minimizing downtime. </em> <li><em>Maximize the coverage of automated tests in the code base. </em></li></ul> <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/websf/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Object%20Container%20DataSource">Object Container DataSource</a>: this is a web control similar to ASP.Net ObjectDataSource but instead of relying on a class that provides you with data it will raises events when it needs the data or when the data contained changes (insert/update/delete). This design allows the view (Web page) to delegate the responsibility of performing select operations, update operations, delete operations, and insert operations to the presenter.  <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/websf/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Using%20the%20Web%20Client%20Software%20Development%20Package">Web Client Development Automation</a>: <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/matiaswoloski/archive/2006/12/12/Web-Client-Software-Factory-Automation.aspx">I posted about this already</a>.  <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/websf/Wiki/View.aspx?title=QuickStarts">QuickStarts</a>: these are the quickstarts included: View-Presenter (with Application Controller), ObjectContainerDataSource, Modularity, Page Flow, Page Flow with Shopping Cart  <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/websf/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Getting%20Started#RI">A Reference Implementation</a>: this is a banking application inspired in a real world example to demonstrate the guidance in action.  <li>Documentation, How-Tos, patterns, etc.: available when you install the factory and soon to be published in the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/websf">codeplex community</a></li></ul> <p>It was 6 months of hard work and it was great working again with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/">patterns &amp; practices</a> team: Blaine (PM), <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/">Eugenio</a> (PDM), <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mpuleio">Mike</a> (Dev Lead), <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/edjez/">Ed</a> (Architect), <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/johnny">Johnny</a> (Dev), <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/mariano/">Mariano</a> (Dev), <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/aridle">Alan</a> (Dev), Bob(Dev), Dragos (Architect), Tim (Tech writer), Juan Carlos (Dev), Prasad (Test) and Terrence (Test).</p>
