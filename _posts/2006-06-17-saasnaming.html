        <span class="q">This week I had a discussion in the aspadvice.com private lists around the "Software as a Service" wording. We agreed with <a href="http://blogs.cyberbizsoft.com/santos/">Santos Ray Victorero</a> that SaaS is not the most representative name for what it means. <br>Here is one of my responses:<br></span><p><span class="q"><i>I do not like it either, but, hey, is not the first time we disagree with naming big things...</i></span></p><p><span class="q"></span></p><p><span class="q"><i>Anyway, better than analyze naming, I would go through the key areas involved in Software as a Service.</i></span></p><p><span class="q"><i>What SaaS enables?</i></span></p><ul><li><span class="q"><i>leverage massive economy of scale by sharing the infrastructure among tenants</i></span></li><li><span class="q"><i>catch the long tail of the market</i></span></li></ul><span class="q"><i>How? </i></span><p><span class="q"><i>My father runs a shop. Buying a full blown server with SQL
2005 and Windows 2003 to run his software is not what he wants. Not
only for the money, but he don't want problems mantaining both
infrastructure and software. However, he needs software that just
works. So this is the value proposition of SaaS. Application
development costs are shared, the
"enterprise grade" application can be offered to very small businesses
as well.</i></span></p><p><span class="q"></span></p><p><span class="q"><i>So, if we are talking about the next big
programming language, SaaS is not that guy. However, this is a social
paradigm shift in terms of software delivery. As more people realize
about the value around this model, more applications will be developed
to fulfill their needs. That means that more tooling, guidance,
abstractions, etc. software companies like Microsoft will deliver. And
we as architect/developers will start writing this kind of applications
sooner or later. </i></span></p><p><span class="q"></span></p><p><span class="q"><i><a href="http://salesforce.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce.com</a>
is the emblema of SaaS nowadays. They are on the CRM arena. Microsoft
with their * Live stuff is heading that way as Ozzie points out in his
memo "<a href="http://www.scripting.com/disruption/ozzie/TheInternetServicesDisruptio.htm">Services Disruption</a>".</i></span></p><p><span class="q"><br>It's late now to change this name because it's in CIO's minds. But let's make the effort to explain this concept clearly!<br></span></p><span class="q"></span>
