<p>Back in June 06 we started this project with the Microsoft Architecture Strategy Team. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gianpaolo/archive/2007/02/08/saas-sample-application-finally-here.aspx">Gianpaolo announced it</a> on thursday, it went live:</p><blockquote><p><em>Repository of the code and related documentation (including webcasts):</em></p><p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/saas/sampleApp"><em>http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/saas/sampleApp</em></a></p><p><em>Community site where architects and developers can discuss in forums, report bugs, suggest and vote on new features, contribute code: </em></p><p><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/litwareHR"><em>http://www.codeplex.com/litwareHR</em></a><em> </em></p><p><em>Bonus material, "behind the scenes", "deleted scenes": </em></p><p><a href="http://www.skyscrapr.net/architects-in-action.aspx"><em>http://www.skyscrapr.net/architects-in-action.aspx</em></a></p></blockquote><p>I&#39;ve been part of this project since the beginning and I gathered lots of knowledge to feed in my thesis. I will hopefully keep researching and working with the AST on all these exciting concepts and the architecture behind it. </p>
