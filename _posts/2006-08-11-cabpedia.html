<span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Socha">John Socha</a>, the guy who wrote the great Norton Commander, created this new wiki called <a href="http://www.cabpedia.com">CABPedia</a> to share information regarding CAB, Smart Client Software Factory and Mobile Client Software Factory.<br>This site was necesary for the CAB community and my vision is<br><br><i>"CABPedia should be simple enough to be the starting point for everyone that wants to use [CAB, SCSF, MCSF] and donâ€™t know where to start <br>but also has the deepness to provide experienced users accurate definitions of every concept around CAB, SCSF, MCSF"<br></i><br>Let's share now!<br><br>
