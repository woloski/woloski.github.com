<p>I've arrived to China after a long journey (~35 hours). I still needs to figure out what's the time and what should I eat. Shanghai is very nice and it looks like any occidental city plenty of people and lights.</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2008/06/chinashangai023.jpg"><img height="386" alt="China, Shangai 023" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2008/06/chinashangai023-thumb.jpg" width="500" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>This week I will present in Chengdu about Software Factories and next week will deliver a 2 day workshop. And of course I will go to the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and squeeze every minute I'm here.</p>
