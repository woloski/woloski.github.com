<p>My good friend <a href="http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/pga/">Pablo Galiano</a> has been working on a <a href="http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/pga/archive/2007/04/03/23974.aspx">VSIP software factory lately</a>. I had never did a VSIP package myself, but it seems like a lot of work to do simple things like adding a command. This software factory provides a bunch of recipes (developed with GAX/GAT) that will do all the dirty job for you.</p> <p>Check it out here: <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/vsipfactory">http://www.codeplex.com/vsipfactory</a></p>
