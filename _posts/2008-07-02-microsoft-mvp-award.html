Being an MVP is a dream I had for some time and it’s great to reach this step!</p>  <p>I’ve been always connected to the community. Participating on lists like aspadvice.com on early stages of .net, sharing knowledge around smart client development through my <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski">blog</a> and <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/scsfcontrib">codeplex</a> and forums and delivering presentations and workshops on different subjects.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>It’s a full-duplex relationship with Microsoft and its community that I had to nurture during time and it’s great to see the recognition.</p>  <p>Thanks to all the people involved and <a href="http://www.southworks.net">Southworks</a> for growing me up and make a dream come true.</p>
