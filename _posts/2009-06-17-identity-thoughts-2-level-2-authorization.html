<p>In my last post I talked about an <a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/2009/05/27/microsoft-architecture-day-roadmap-to-identity/">identity roadmap</a> and how we are helping companies to achieve <strong>Level 1: Externalizing Authentication</strong>. In this first level, we only care about checking the credentials of a user in a Security Token Service and issue a token with a couple of claims. That token will be enough to prove access to the application. </p>  <p>Reaching the <strong>Level 1 </strong>will make a great difference to the IT department of a given company. By having a central login place they will be able to answer to questions like “when someone logged in to a certain application?”, “which applications someone used in this timeframe?”, etc. In terms of governance, having a single way to implement login will allow the architecture department (if any) to decrease security threats because there is a single well thought piece of infrastructure to perform user authentication across all apps. As a side effect it will also reduce costs of development and maintenance. </p>  <p><strong>Level 2 </strong>talks about the <strong>authorization </strong>process. The authorization decision happens near the application or the service because it knows about the resource (each application has a different domain model).</p>  <p><strong>Geneva Server – Level 1 Authentication</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>SSO &amp; Federation – unified login experience and federation with partners</li>    <li>Centralized Claim Mapping management</li>    <li>Externalize authentication</li>    <li>Near the identity provider</li>    <li>Questions it will answer</li>    <ul>     <li>When a subject logged in to an app? </li>      <li>What claims the subject presented to the app?</li>   </ul> </ul>  <p><strong>Policy Server&#160; - Level 2 Authorization</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Policy Enforcement</li>    <li>Centralized Policy Rules management</li>    <li>Externalize authorization</li>    <li>Near the application</li>    <li>Questions it will answer</li>    <ul>     <li>What permissions did the subject requested? </li>      <li>What permissions where denied?</li>   </ul> </ul>  <p>The following figure shows a very high level architecture of the components and its interactions</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2009/06/image1.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2009/06/image-thumb1.png" width="640" height="472" /></a></p>  <p><strong>Resources</strong></p>  <p>[XACML] <a title="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xacml/" href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xacml/">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xacml/</a>    <br />[Geneva Server] <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/content/content.aspx?ContentID=10106&amp;SiteID=642">http://connect.microsoft.com/content/content.aspx?ContentID=10106&amp;SiteID=642</a>    <br />[SAML] <a title="http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/#samlv2.0" href="http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/#samlv2.0">http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/#samlv2.0</a></p>
