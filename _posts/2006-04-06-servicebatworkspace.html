        <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http%3A//blogs.msdn.com/donsmith/&amp;ei=vTI0RK3QFKzc4QGT4sCXBA&amp;sig2=aul9DQ20wBpVSeEPoyCSHQ">Don Smith</a> announced today that  <b><strike>Service BAT</strike> Service Factory is finally a public project. </b>I've been part of this project since the beginning of the year and I can tell you that I'm pretty excited about it. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/thehoggblog/archive/2006/04/03/567323.aspx">Jason Hogg</a> said that this were going to change the way we develop SO applications.<br>
<br>
<b>This is a great moment for people writing Service Oriented apps using Microsoft technologies!</b><br>
<br>
First, if you are not aware of patterns &amp; practices latest
activities, let me tell you that they've been creating BATs, Baseline
Architecture Toolkits, which are more than App Blocks. They cover the
whole thing! The first one was the <a href="http://codegallery.gotdotnet.com/scbat">SC-BAT</a> (for Smart Client apps using CAB) which was more than successful. So here is the definition:<br>
<br>
Â <b>What is a BAT</b>? A BAT is a collection of various forms of guidance (written
guidance like patterns, reusable code like application blocks,
executable code like reference implementations, and guidance packages
embedded in Visual Studio) to help .NET developers and architects build
a certain kind of application.<br>
<br>
<b>What is the scope of <strike>Service BAT</strike> Service Factory?</b> In short, from the proxy to the database.<br>
