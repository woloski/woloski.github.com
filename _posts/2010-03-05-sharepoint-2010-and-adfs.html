<p>Iâ€™ve seen a few questions on identity federation with SharePoint before, so I thought about sharing this more broadly.    <br />I recorded a <a href="http://snipurl.com/sp2010adfs">9 minutes screencast</a> showing the capabilities of ADFSv2 + SharePoint 2010. This is using Microsoft STS, LiveID and our own company STS allowing the following usecases:</p>  <ul>   <li>Manage access to employees that belong to the Active Directory </li>    <li>Manage access to partners that has their own STS </li>    <li>Manage access to certain webparts, doc libraries or lists through Sharepoint groups and claims </li>    <li>Allow/deny access to Windows LiveID users </li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://snipurl.com/sp2010adfs"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2010/03/image2.png" width="400" height="307" /></a></p>
