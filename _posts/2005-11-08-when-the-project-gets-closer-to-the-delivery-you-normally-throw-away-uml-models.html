        I haven't said it. It was <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/dw_blog.jspa?blog=317">Grady Booch</a> at <a href="http://www.oopsla.org/">OOPSLA '05</a>. And I fully agree with him :) <br>
That's why <a href="/blogs/matiaswoloski/archive/2005/11/02/TechnightMdd.aspx">the next friday I will show the DSL toolkit</a>
which is a framework from Microsoft to model concepts of your business
not tied to any particular designer or notation. You can do your own
designer and code-generation artifacts around it and they will survive
all the phases of the project because are business concepts and not
implementation concepts.<br>
