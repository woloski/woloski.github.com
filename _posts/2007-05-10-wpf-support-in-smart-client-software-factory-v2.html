<p>Read <a href="/blogs/msaez/archive/2007/04/29/WPF-Support-in-SCSF.aspx">Miguel's post about the upcoming support for WPF</a>.</p>  <p>There is no black magic. Simply you will be able to treat WPF smartparts as you treated Winforms smartpart (i.e. dependency injection will apply).</p>  <p>Also you will get a recipe to add a WPF view with a presenter.</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2008/06/wpfview.png"><img height="237" alt="WpfView" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2008/06/wpfview-thumb.png" width="342" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>People who invested in CAB will have a smooth migration path from Winforms to WPF and a familiar programming model.</p>
