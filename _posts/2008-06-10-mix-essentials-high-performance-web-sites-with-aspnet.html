<p>Last week, June 4th, together with Pablo Costantini (aÂ coworker specialist on web technologies) we delivered a presentation about high performance websites at the local <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/conosur/mix/">MIX event</a>. There is a well known book from <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com">Steve Souders</a>, former Chief Performance Officer of Yahoo! called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596529309?tag=stevsoud-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0596529309&amp;adid=1S1KP4EV129EN37422C0&amp;">High Performance Web Sites</a> and we based the presentation on it, and also showed how to implement the rules using Microsoft technlogies (ASP.NET in particular)</p><p><img height="500" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FqC3WOBYL._SS500_.jpg" style="width: 500px;height: 500px" width="500" /></p><p>The attendees gave us good feedback saying that the presentation was pragmatic and straight to the point. </p><p><img height="339" src="http://www.twitxr.com/image/55997/" style="width: 604px;height: 339px" width="604" /></p><p>In my opinion, this book and the tips we gave are things we usually oversee in web applications that can really make a difference on user experience. We achieved 40-50% of response time reduction by applying them and the effort is virtually zero.</p><p>Feel free to reuse the deck and the demo that are published <a href="http://cid-842c7f2005a1673e.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/Public/WebPerfPresentationMIX08">here</a>.</p>
