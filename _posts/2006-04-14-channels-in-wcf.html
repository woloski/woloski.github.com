        On Augus 22nd. 2005 I left a <a href="http://kennyw.com/indigo/40">comment</a> in <a href="http://kennyw.com">Kenny's Wolf blog</a>:<br>
<br>    [on writing custom channels]<br><span style="font-style: italic">    "...I think there should be more documentation and examples regarding the
different interfaces provided (IOutputChannel, IRequestChannel,
IReplyChannel, etc). I didnâ€™t know which one I would need in my
bindingelement."</span><br>
<br>
9 months later...<br>
<br>    Resources for Custom Channel Authors:<br>    <a href="http://windowscommunication.net/customchannels/customchannels.htm">http://windowscommunication.net/customchannels/customchannels.htm</a><br>
<br>
This is the place to go if you ever want to take <a href="http://windowscommunication.net">WCF</a> to the limit by writing a custom channel<br>
On a side note, I must admit these guys created a master piece of
software. <a href="http://windowscommunication.net/">WCF</a> is the most extensible thing I ever seen in my life.<br>
