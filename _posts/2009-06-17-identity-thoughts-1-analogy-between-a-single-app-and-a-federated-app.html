<p>The following table shows an analogy of identity concepts between a single application and a federated application. </p>  <p>The single app has its own identity silo and the federated app relies on an STS (like <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/content/content.aspx?ContentID=10106&amp;SiteID=642">Geneva Server</a>). I find this analogy useful to explain how things differ from the non-federated non-claim-based world.</p>  <p><a href="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2009/06/image.png"><img border="0" alt="image" src="http://blogs.southworks.net/mwoloski/files/2009/06/image-thumb.png" width="640" height="262" /></a></p>
