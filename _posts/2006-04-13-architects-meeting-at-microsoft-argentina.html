        <p class="MsoNormal">Last week Roberto Schatz, DPE Architect, and Ramiro Iturregui, ISV Developer, organized an
Architects meeting at Microsoft,
 Argentina. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/eugeniop/">Eugenio Pace</a>, Product Manager for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/">patterns &amp; practices</a>, and me,
talked about many exciting things including:</p>


<ul style="margin-top: 0cm" type="square">
<li class="MsoNormal">The
     current status of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/practices/">patterns
     &amp; practices</a> group.<span> </span>Patterns
     &amp; practices wonâ€™t be an isolated group anymore; they will be part of a
     product team that will enroll Visual Studio Team System, p&amp;p and MSF
     together. </li><li class="MsoNormal">What
     patterns &amp; practices been working on? In the UX area CAB was broadly
     adopted and now the <a href="http://practices.gotdotnet.com/projects/scbat">SCBAT</a>
     (Smart Client Baseline Architecture Toolkit) is what the developer needs to
     create a Smart Client application. Including guidance right into Visual
     Studio 2005 using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/workshop/gat/">GAT</a> (right-click
     -&gt; Add Cab Module, etc), documentation, hands on labs, and two
     reference implementations showing how to manage offline scenarios,
     multiple modules, role-based UI, among other things. </li><li class="MsoNormal">There
     is news also in the services area (everything that goes from the proxy to
     the database). The SVCBAT (Service BAT) now renamed to <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=6fde9247-53a8-4879-853d-500cd2d97a83">Web
     Service Software Factory</a>, has been launched and the <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/releases/viewuploads.aspx?id=6fde9247-53a8-4879-853d-500cd2d97a83">first
     drop is available</a>. I encourage you to download it and give feedback
     about your needs in this space. </li>
</ul>




<p class="MsoNormal"> Finally, we did some Q&amp;A and gathered some feedback. There
were interesting questions about the past, the present and the future of p&amp;p
deliverables. Thankfully, some attractive croissants entered the room because I
was starving already. <span style="font-family: Wingdings"><span>J</span></span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.ajlopez.com/">Angel Lopez</a> who was there and <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/lopez/default.aspx">blogged</a>
about it</p>
