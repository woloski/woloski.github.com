<p>It was on December 2006 when I first looked at this new framework on a developer lab at Redmond. I'm a big supporter of CAB as you may noticed if you read this blog and that is why I was invited. They want feedback. Acropolis grabbed many concepts and patterns that were successful in <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/smartclient">CAB</a>, so people who invested in CAB and/or <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/smartclient">SCSF</a> will have a seamless migration path and will understand Acropolis without too much hassle. Read <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2007/06/06/acropolis-the-future-of-smart-client.aspx">this post from Glenn</a> for more information on the future of CAB/SCSF.</p> <p><a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/ejadib">Ezequiel Jadib</a> is starting a set of posts/tutorials for Acropolis and the first is the classic <a href="http://staff.southworks.net/blogs/ejadib/archive/2007/06/06/Hello-World-with-Acropolis.aspx">hello world</a> using a Part and a Command with the default layout. </p>
